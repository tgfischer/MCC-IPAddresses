Microsoft Coding Competition - IP Addresses
===============

This was a question that I solved during the Microsoft Coding Competition in September 2014

"You are a Network Admin for your company and your day-to-day activity includes interacting with IP addresses and network subnets. Today, you will focus only on the IPv4 protocol. You have a situation for which you need to determine if a given IP address belongs to a subnet. To do so, you must compare the candidate IP address with the range of the subnet. Consider an example subnet that begins at 10.0.0.1 and ends at 11.199.88.254. For this subnet, 10.43.59.96 is within range, while 111.19.12.154 is outside of the range. Note that your input may also contain invalid IP addresses such as 12500.58.18. Any IP address that is incorrectly formatted, is less than 0.0.0.0, or is greater than 255.255.255.255 is an invalid IP address.

In summary, your task is to determine whether an IP address is within range, out side of range, or invalid.

Input description/format
===============
Each line of the input will contain 3 IP Addresses, separated by spaces:
•	The first IP address represents the first valid IP address of the subnet.
•	The second IP address represents the 
last valid IP address of the subnet.
•	The 3rd IP address is the address to validate.

Output description/format
===============

For each line of input, output the result in one of the following 3 ways (case sensitive):
•	InRange
•	InValid
•	OutRange

Example input
===============
10.0.0.1 11.199.88.254 1000.43.59.96
10.0.0.1 11.199.88.254 10.43.59.96
10.0.0.1 11.199.88.254 111.19.12.154

Example output
===============
InValid
InRange
OutRange"
